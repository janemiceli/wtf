## First website 


I found my first real website on wayback machine. I downloaded it using [https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader). Then put it up for hosting on github. [This](https://janemiceli.github.io/maryandtim.net/index.html) is the turn out without making any code changes.
