## First website 


I found my first real website on wayback machine. I downloaded it using 
[wayback-machine-downloader](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader). Then put it up for hosting on github. [This](https://janemiceli.github.io/maryandtim.net/index.html) is the turnout without making any code changes. Circa 2004/2005. [This](https://janemiceli.github.io/maryandtim.net.revised/index.html) is with some code changes.
