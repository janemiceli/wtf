## Fuck 

Decided that a word was used excessively in a book I was listening to so I wanted to find out how many times it was used. I downloaded it, removed DRM and converted to mp3, used AWS Transcribe to convert to text and then searched it for number of instances.
$ grep -iohR "fuck" *.json | wc -l
338

```powershell
$ grep -iohR "fuck" *.json | wc -l
338
```
In the unabridged audiobook that has a run time of 317 minutes, its clear that the use averaged more then 1x usage a minute. 
More then 1x a minute for more then 5 hours.....
